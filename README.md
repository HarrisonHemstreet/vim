# VIM NOTES
## VIM COMMANDS I LIKE:
1. `:%s/[to replace]/[to replace with]` Search through current file and replace all instances with something else
2. hover over any word and hit `SHIFT + 8`

### Things I want my Vim to do:
#### Navigating:
1. file tree DONE `CTL + n`
2. search by file name quick and easy DONE `CTL + p` using the fzf plugin

3. search for text within files/directories DONE `:Rg` also checkout using `:Blines` for searching through the lines of the current buffer, or `:lines` for searching through all open buffers
4. Have tabs and easily switch between them DONE 
5. Be able to use window splits both on the same file and two different files, be able to use buffers TODO

#### Coding:
1. autocomplete on a tab hit KINDA DONE
2. I want to know which lines I've changed DONE
3. I want the ability to search for a specific piece of text and replace all instances of it
4. I want to easily know the origin of functions or objects, etc (look up "ctabs"?)
5. Syntax highlighting for JavaScript, Node, React, PHP, Python
